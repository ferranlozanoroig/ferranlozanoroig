### :man_technologist: About Me :

- :telescope: I am currently taking part in the Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperDev which teaches React, Vue and its various frameworks. I have mainly been focused on building backend applications and have also dipped into the world of data science.  
  
- :seedling: Recently, I started building a full-stack platform for discovering early stage musicians and their debut work. With it, I faced the challenge of creating a good recommendation algorithm that tackles both the â€˜cold-startâ€™ problem, as well as the â€˜over-recommendationâ€™ problem. For my application, I initially started using the apriory algorithm, then moved to the cosine similarity. This triggered my curiosity to study graph-based recommendation systems more in depth to create a smarter recommendation solution.

- ðŸ’¼ Here are some projects I have worked on so far together with a quick preview
  - [Terminal](https://github.com/spas-mirchev/learning-projects/tree/main/Termina](https://github.com/ferranlozanoroig/512kbRes)l)
  - [UI](https://github.com/spas-mirchev/learning-projects/tree/main/UI](https://github.com/ferranlozanoroig/512kbRes))
  - Data science projects (coming soon!)
